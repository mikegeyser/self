  <h1>
    Hi, I'm Mike!
  </h1>
  <div class="paragraph">
    I’m a Tech Lead at BBD in the R&D team, specialising on designing and building for the web. I’ve been hacking on the web
    since Geocities was a thing, have a long-lived love affair with JavaScript, and have (almost) come to terms with the
    fact that I will never have a programmer beard. I have been working as a professional software developer for over 12
    years. While I have worked on some interesting large-scale enterprise applications, it is the challenges of the public
    web that really appeal to me - having earned my stripes on high volume transactional websites. I work primarily in JavaScript,
    C# and Java, and have shipped production applications in a variety of frameworks.
