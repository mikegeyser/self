title: Building PWAs with React and Workbox
description: The holy grail of web applications is having them be near-native performance, and to a large degree this has driven the JavaScript revolution. To truly realise that goal we need to embrace native design thinking for our applications, applying it not only to our code but also to our content. Using ideas from Progressive Web Applications, a modern framework such as React, and good tooling in the form of Workbox we can create engaging, fast and available application experiences - the best of both native and web. This code-oriented talk will show how to practically use select principles of Progressive Web Applications in conjunction with React and Workbox to create fast and compelling web experiences. It will cover the creation of an application shell and go into using service workers for preloading, caching and offline support.
