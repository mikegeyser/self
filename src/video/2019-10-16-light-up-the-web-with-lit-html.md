title: Light up the web with lit-html
description: "What if I told you that building on the web could be easier? What if I told you that you didn't need complicated frameworks, confusing tools and convoluted builds? Let me introduce you to my little friend; lit-html 🔥. At only 3.5kb gzipped (⁉️) this minuscule framework leverages off of the modern web platform to make it efficient, expressive, and extensible. In this code oriented talk, I hope to show how low friction it is to work with lit-html. Together we'll build a TodoMVC application, starting from first principles and ending with WebComponents - all with (almost) zero tooling. Come and see for yourself: the web can be easy, fun and lit 🔥."

# Light up the web with lit-html

What if I told you that building on the web could be easier? What if I told you that you didn't need complicated frameworks, confusing tools and convoluted builds? Let me introduce you to my little friend; lit-html 🔥. At only 3.5kb gzipped (⁉️) this minuscule framework leverages off of the modern web platform to make it efficient, expressive, and extensible.

In this code oriented talk, I hope to show how low friction it is to work with lit-html. Together we'll build a TodoMVC application, starting from first principles and ending with WebComponents - all with (almost) zero tooling. Come and see for yourself: the web can be easy, fun and lit 🔥.
