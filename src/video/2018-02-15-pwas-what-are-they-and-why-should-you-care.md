In the case of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), it's become very difficult to pin down exactly what they are. Are they indeed the 'next big thing'™ or are they just another fashion trend. Will life carry on if you let the PWA train pass you by, or should you be paying attention? This talk will explain what PWAs are, and what they are not. It will detail the design patterns, technologies and philosophies that they are composed of. Finally, it will look at real world usage trends, for both web and mobile, and attempt to answer the burning question: should you care about PWAs?
