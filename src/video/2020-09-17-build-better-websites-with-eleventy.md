title: Build better websites with Eleventy
description: We have lost the art of building websites. Don't get me wrong, we build for the World Wide Web all of the time. We build Apps and Components and Services and Content Management Systems, but we seldom just build websites. A surprisingly large amount of what we build can (and probably should) just be HTML, CSS and a (small) sprinkling of JavaScript. We have this stigma against building static pages, which is largely unfounded. Well, enter Eleventy, the static site generator that we deserve. Join me as I show you how to build simple, easy, engaging websites using Eleventy. We'll look at the basic premise of the tool, as well how to customise it to suit your needs. By the end of this talk you will have a newfound respect for static websites, and be armed with everything you need to build better websites.

We have this stigma against building static pages, which is largely unfounded. Well, enter Eleventy, the static site generator that we deserve.
