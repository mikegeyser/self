title: The Polymer PWA Starter Kit
description: Today we will build a PWA! We will take one part polymer, one part lit-html, and one part redux. We will then mix thoroughly and place on top of a sw-precache configured service worker. Covering the result with a combination of chrome puppeteer and WCT suites, we will bake it for approximately 45 minutes using the polymer-cli. This code-heavy talk will look at lit-html, LitElement, and the PWA Starter Kit. We will explore how the starter kit is set up, and build a simple PWA using it.
