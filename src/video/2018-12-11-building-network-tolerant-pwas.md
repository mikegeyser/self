title: Now, Now-Now, and Just-Now; Building Network Tolerant PWAs
description: Web experiences are brittle. There are lots of things that break them; poor network coverage, over-subscribed access points, power interruptions and even cable theft. Historically, we have simply shrugged and given up, but now we can do better. The widespread availability of service worker, complemented with good tooling such as workbox, allow us to effectively address intermittent connectivity. This code-oriented talk will show how to practically use workbox to create robust, network tolerant web experiences. It will cover the creation of service workers for preloading, caching, and even full offline support using the background sync API.

# Now, Now-Now, and Just-Now: Building Network Tolerant PWAs

Web experiences are brittle. There are lots of things that break them: poor network coverage, over-subscribed access points, power interruptions and even cable theft. Historically, we have simply shrugged and given up, but now we can do better. The widespread availability of service worker, complemented with good tooling such as workbox, allow us to effectively address intermittent connectivity. This code-oriented talk will show how to practically use workbox to create robust, network tolerant web experiences. It will cover the creation of service workers for preloading, caching, and even full offline support using the background sync API.
