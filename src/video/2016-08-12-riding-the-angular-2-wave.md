title: Riding the Angular 2 wave
description: The imminent release of Angular 2 is poised like a tsunami, ready to take the World Wide Web by storm, and will inevitably drag the entire JavaScript ecosystem along for the ride. Angular 2 sees itself less as a framework, and more as a platform on which to craft your single page applications. This session will uncover the cornerstone of an angular application by illustrating the new web-component based design, improved dependency injection, and unidirectional data flow. It will also demonstrate the routing model, templating and practical debugging. Everything needed to kick start a project, and start riding the Angular 2 wave.

# Riding the Angular 2 wave

The imminent release of Angular 2 is poised like a tsunami, ready to take the World Wide Web by storm, and will inevitably drag the entire JavaScript ecosystem along for the ride. Angular 2 sees itself less as a framework, and more as a platform on which to craft your single page applications. This session will uncover the cornerstone of an angular application by illustrating the new web-component based design, improved dependency injection, and unidirectional data flow. It will also demonstrate the routing model, templating and practical debugging. Everything needed to kick start a project, and start riding the Angular 2 wave.
