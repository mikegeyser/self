title: Diagnosing performance problems with Lighthouse
description: Performance is a feature. It is arguably the most important feature of modern web experiences, but at times it can be a dark art. Complex build tools, confusing profilers and an abundance of metrics make it seem like one has to be a true web wizard to understand it all. It shouldn’t be hard and luckily isn’t - provided you use the right tools. Built directly into Chrome, the Lighthouse audit reports drive away from the darkness and shine a spotlight on the opportunities available to you, making it easy to improve. This talk will provide a detailed walkthrough of optimising performance using the Lighthouse audit report. By way of a challenging application, we will identify and implement performance optimisations. We will make small, measurable changes to improving our web application, taking one easy step at a time.
