title: A (Re)Introduction to JavaScript
description: JavaScript is weird. It is a product of its failures as much as its successes. As a language, it is both modern and outdated. Cross-platform, yet not. Interpreted, but can be compiled. Loved, yet reviled. 'Good' JavaScript written a year ago looks very different to what one might write today, never mind code written 10 years ago. Every year a new set of features is ratified into the ECMAScript standard and is rolled out by browser manufacturers. This continual evolution can be frustrating and confusing but provides us with a unique opportunity. To embrace change, unlearn what we take for granted, and fall in love with JavaScript (again). This talk will attempt to (re)introduce this contrarian language, addressing novices and veterans alike. It will make fun of JavaScript's foibles, mitigate its faults, and emphasize its strengths. It won't attempt to divorce it from context but will show which parts of the language you can use and when you should use them.
