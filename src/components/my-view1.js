            Hi, I'm Mike!
          </h1>
          <p>
            I’m a Tech Lead at BBD in the R&D team, specialising on designing and building for the
            web. I’ve been hacking on the web since Geocities was a thing, have a long-lived love
            affair with JavaScript, and have (almost) come to terms with the fact that I will never
            have a programmer beard. I have been working as a professional software developer for
            over 12 years. While I have worked on some interesting large-scale enterprise
            applications, it is the challenges of the public web that really appeal to me - having
            earned my stripes on high volume transactional websites. I work primarily in JavaScript,
            C# and Java, and have shipped production applications in a variety of frameworks.
